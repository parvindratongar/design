                    <p>
                        My web timeline mobile app helps people to save many types of multimedia files at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It can save single snippet or in groups as well. It has Ideastream functionality. If we start
                        Ideastream, all media files created at that period of time will save in an Ideastream (group).
                        For example I am in a meeting so I can take Photos, Videos, Voice Msgs, Text Notes etc in a
                        single Ideastream with the custom title.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        User can customise snippets after save. We can create Ideastream to select two or more snippets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through Share-In functionality we can save snippets from other social media applications like
                        Twitter and Linkedin

                    Mr K.M. was in the second meeting with the clients but when he searched some images and text notes
                    and voice recordings so he face difficulty to find first meeting voice recording and images quickly
                    but it takes a lot of time to find everything quickly and easily so he got frustrated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Mr K.M.
                    try to find some app which can help to find all types of media and files of that meeting but he
                    didnâ€™t find any. Then he decided to create their own app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a unique app to save all types of
                    media files of a meeting or a function. We can save files in groups as well as individual.

                <h2 class="mb-5">Understanding the problem</h2>
                <p>
                    I conducted a brainstorming workshop with the team to uncover pains felt by individuals. It was
                    revealed that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Individuals were face the same problem but never think about the solution</li>
                    <li>Individuals wanted to take action on reducing their time efforts to accomplish all content of
                        that occasions but didn't know where to begin</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container-fluid light-orange-bg">
            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="mb-5">Product vision and solution</h2>
                <p>
                    From these findings, we decided as a product to identify key business goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>We want users to understand the impact of their current usage</li>
                    <li>We want users to take actions to use this app and reduce effort</li>
                    <li>We want users to understand how their actions positively save our time</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a starting point, we each did some market research on competitors to investigate the current
                    offerings in the market and take inspiration from particular features that we liked about each app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then conducted a 15 minute sketching session to encourage each member of the team to draw out
                    their vision of the solution.

                <h2>Defining the MVP</h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the sketching sessions, it was revealed that there were commonalties in the product vision.
                    We identified the following key user stories:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a Snippet. Users can add a snippet individual e.g. click photo(s), video(s), text etc.</li>
                    <li>Create a Ideastream(group of snippets). Users can start Ideastream button with a single click
                        and make multiple snippets of all types available in the app etc.</li>
                    <li>Share In. Users can share snippets from other social media sites. It will save as a snippet.
                        Snippet should be Individual or in Ideastream.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for the engineers to begin on the architecture, I mocked up the main screens for the MVP
                    based off the sketches created by me and came up with the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Login screen</li>
                    <li>Register profile</li>
                    <li>Home page</li>
                    <li>Add Individual Snippet</li>
                    <li>Create Ideastream (a group of posts)</li>
                    <li>Share-In</li>
                    <li>Quick Snippet</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Designs</h2>
                <p>
                    I quickly completed some mockups of the basic user journey before going over it with the desired
                    styling. I opted for a refreshing gradient look and the simplicity of the UI. I then created for the
                    developers a viewable prototype in Sketch.

                    I used Figma to allow the engineers to inspect the Code of the designs. The team used Flutter to
                    develop the application. It is accessible via Android and iOS apps.
